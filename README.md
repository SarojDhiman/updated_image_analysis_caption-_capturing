Language Detection and Text Extraction from Images
Overview
This Python project uses Tesseract OCR along with image processing techniques to detect the language of text in images and extract the text. The application employs the Tesseract OCR engine and OpenCV for preprocessing to improve text recognition accuracy.

Features
Language Detection: Determines the language of the text in an image from a predefined set of languages.
Text Extraction: Extracts text from images using Tesseract OCR.
Image Preprocessing: Utilizes OpenCV for preprocessing to enhance text extraction results.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for the script.
pytesseract: Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine.
Pillow (PIL): Python Imaging Library for opening and manipulating image files.
OpenCV: Library for image processing tasks.
Installation
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x

Tesseract-OCR: Install Tesseract from here and ensure it is added to your system PATH.
Usage
Prepare Your Image: Place the image file you want to process in an accessible directory. Update the image_path variable in the script with the path to your image file.

Run the Script: Execute the Python script to detect the language, preprocess the image, and extract text.
View Results: The script will print the detected language, the confidence of the detection, and the extracted text.

Script Details
Key Components
LANGUAGE_NAMES: A dictionary mapping language codes to their full names.
get_confidence(image, lang): Function to calculate the confidence of OCR results for a given language.
determine_language(image): Function to detect the language of the text in the image based on the highest confidence value.
Image Preprocessing: Includes conversion to grayscale, blurring, thresholding, and noise removal using OpenCV.
